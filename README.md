# boilerform
Minimum SASS framework for forms.

## Why
Browsers have unique behavior to treat it's forms.
The idea is create a simple css framework to adjust what can be totally different,
like input search in safari, input range in all browsers, etc.

## How
Creating a pattern to forms, adjusting select, textareas, input search, etc.

The project use Gulp as a SASS compiler, and pure html to create the pattern.

Gulp command to watch sass files:

`$ gulp watch`
